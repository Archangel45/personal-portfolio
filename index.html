		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hello there! My name is Archangel, nepetax, Jackie or Franco.</p>

		<h2>Programmer and geekish info</h2>
		<p>I'm a 19 year old entry-level hobbyist programmer who is still a rookie but it's enough for me to program things now. I love programming as much as you do.</p>

		<p>I also use the Linux operating system (Ubuntu is my choice) and I'm stlll a rookie to Linux, but some of my friends are helping me to become a better Linux user.</p>

		<p>Me being a programmer and a Linux user, I also do a little bit of web development. I'm planning to use server-side scripting soon but I'll have to stick with client-side like HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</p>

		<h2>Other info about me</h2>
		<p>Finally, I love astronomy and art. For art I draw colorful pastel ponies either in traditional or digital. I also do pixel art.</p>

		<p>For astronomy, I play some space games and surf the net about astronomy.</p>
